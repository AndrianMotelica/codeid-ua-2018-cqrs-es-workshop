### Basic CQRS and Event Sourcing with Prooph

Interactive part of the process:

- [ ] Create the middleware to `/result` page
- [ ] Create a projector to save export information to a file, counting how much move was made to complete the game.
- [ ] Trigger a new domain event like `ReportResultWasExported`
- [ ] Send a fake mail when `ReportResultWasExported`
